# EEGclassification
This project was submitted as part of UPF's CSIM master's real-time interaction course. 
In this project we first read raw EEG data from .xdf file, work through the EEG pre-processing workflow, 
before building a classifier to analyze the results

One test file has been included (only my own to respect privacy of other participants), annachess_test.xdf.
Due to resources, the project was completed using an old Emotiv Epoch device which was unable to pick up a true EEG signal.

One_channel contains the full work-flow for the project including the classifier, however to run one should select only annachess_test.xdf
and comment out the other two test xdf files.
